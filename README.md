### Vue infinite-scroll
> [Demo](https://vue-infinite-scroll-ruofanwei.vercel.app/)
### Features
- load more data while user scroll view to
bottom
    - way 1 : use [event listeners on the scroll, resize and orientationChange events in the browser](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-handlers-on-elements,-document-objects,-and-window-objects)
    - way 2 : using the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) detect when an element enters the viewport and take an action
    - event listeners vs. Intersection Observer
        - using the Intersection Observer API action is triggered quicker and the site doesnâ€™t appear sluggish at all
        - using the event listeners, we had to add a timeout to make it performant
            > (slightly negative impact on the user experience as the data load is triggered with a slight delay.)

- e2e test
    - simulate user scroll view to bottom and observe the load more action


### Setup

- commit message follow the [Conventional Commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
